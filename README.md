`postgresqltuner.pl` analyses your PostgreSQL instance and produces a report, giving hints.  It is inspired by [mysqltuner.pl](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl)

## Demo

Here is a sample output:

=====  Configuration advice  =====
-----  checkpoint  -----
[URGENT] set fsync to on!
-----  extension  -----
[LOW] Enable pg_stat_statements in database template1 to collect statistics on all queries (not only those longer than log_min_duration_statement)
-----  hugepages  -----
[LOW] Change Huge Pages size from 2MB to 1GB
[MEDIUM] set vm.nr_hugepages=21001 in /etc/sysctl.conf and run sysctl -p to reload it.  This will allocate Huge Pages (it may require a system reboot).

## To use it

### Install it

It needs Perl with various modules, mainly `DBD::Pg`


- On Debian or a derivative:
```
apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl libdbi-perl perl-modules
```
- On Fedora or a derivative:
```
dnf install perl-DBD-Pg perl-DBI perl-Term-ANSIColor perl-Memoize
```
- On Arch or a derivative:
```
pacman -S perl-dbi perl-dbd-pg
```

- On MacOS with Homebrew:
```
brew install perl
cpan DBD-pg
```

Download the script.  Invoke one of:

```
wget -O postgresqltuner.pl postgresqltuner.pl
wget -O postgresqltuner.pl https://postgresqltuner.pl
curl -Lo postgresqltuner.pl postgresqltuner.pl
curl -Lo postgresqltuner.pl https://postgresqltuner.pl
```

Set permissions:

```
chmod +x postgresqltuner.pl
```

Then invoke on the command line, as the "postgres" user, either:

- By connecting to the PostgreSQL server via TCP:
```
postgresqltuner.pl --host=dbhost --database=testdb --user=username --password=qwerty
```
- ... or via an Unix socket:
```
postgres$ postgresqltuner.pl --host=/var/run/postgresql  # PostgreSQL socket directory
```

If available, postgresqltuner.pl will use standard PostgreSQL variables like `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSERNAME`, and password from the `~/.pgpass` file.


### With Docker

Invoke on the command-line either:
 - via the plain network:
```
docker run -it --rm jfcoz/postgresqltuner --host=dbhost --user=username --password=pass --database=testdb
```
 - ... or via ssh:
```
docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh jfcoz/postgresqltuner --host=dbhost --user=username --password=pass --database=testdb
```
 - ... or via a docker link:
```
docker run -it --rm --link your-postgresql-container:dbhost jfcoz/postgresqltuner --host=dbhost --user=username --password=pass --database=testdb
```

### SSH

When using postgresqltuner.pl to inspect a remote PostgreSQL instance, it will use ssh to collect OS informations. You should configure ssh to connect to the remote host with private key authentication.

You can provide adequate options to ssh:

- ... as commend-line options:
```
--sshopt=Port=2200 --sshopt=IdentityFile=...
```

- or in the configuration file "~/.ssh/config":
```
Host my-database-host
	IdentityFile=...
	Port=2200
```

### PostgreSQL passwords

For better security use a `~/.pgpass` file containing passwords, so no password will be saved in your shell history nor visible in a process complete name. [.pgpass documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html)

```
host:port:database:username:password
```

## Options

- Average number of work_mem buffer per connection:

A complex query can use many work_mem buffers. You can configure the average number of work_mem buffers per connection (in percent):

```
--wmp 300
```
The default in 150%

- SSD storage:

If the PostgreSQL instance runs in an hypervisor or with SSD storage, I cannot detect it accurately.
```
--ssd
```
Allow to specify that storage is on SSD. Especially useful if PostgreSQL runs in a VM using an underlying (on the physical machine) SSD.

- No color

The report will not be colorized.  Useful to save it in a file by using shell redirection.
```
--nocolor
```

- Skip ssh

When running against an RDS, it is not possible to have a ssh connection to the instance. The option `skip-ssh` option skips the ssh connection and related checks. However, without ssh the script won't be able to search for total_memory. In this case it is possible to manually inform it by using the `memory` parameter. This way we can still have the memory ratio warnings. The memory value should be in **bytes**.
```
--skip-ssh --memory=8219082752
```

## Special FreeBSD settings

FreeBSD has support for virtual memory over-commit, using vm.overcommit configuration setting.

This setting is configured via /etc/sysctl.conf.

Change 'vm.overcommit: 0 ' to 'vm.overcommit: 1'.

Also, install [freecolor](https://kukunotes.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/freebsd-view-memory-usage/).
